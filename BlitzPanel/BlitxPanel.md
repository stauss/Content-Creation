## Intuitive Design

Drag & Drop
---
Place components directly onto rails or backplates with a simple drag-and-drop. Snap-to-fit alignment and smart guides make panel design feel as intuitive as moving blocks on a canvas.


## Parts at Your Fingertips

Expansive Library
---
Search like you would on Digi-Key or McMaster, but with components already tailored for control panels. Every part comes pre-loaded with specs, footprints, and compliance data so you can drop it straight into your design.


## See Before You Build

3D Viewer
---
Rotate, zoom, and inspect your panel in a real-time 3D viewer. Catch fit and clearance issues early, and share interactive previews with teammates or customers before you commit to production.


## Price as You Design

Instant Quoting
---
Skip the back-and-forth. Get live cost estimates as you design, factoring parts, panel layout, and build effort. Whether you’re tweaking a BOM or planning a full build, you’ll always know where your budget stands.


## Designed Online. Built Automatically.

Smart Factory
---
Our factory integration turns your online design into precise machine code and work instructions: wiring lists, CNC cutouts, and part labels. Your panel design is ready for assembly and manufacturing the moment you accept our quote.


## Frequently Asked Questions

What is Blitzpanel Studio?
--
Blitzpanel Studio is an online tool for designing and sourcing industrial control panels. Think of it as CAD + sourcing + instant quoting in one place. No more juggling spreadsheets, catalogs, and emails.

Is this just software?

Do I have to send my design to your factory?
---
No. You can use Blitzpanel purely as a design and sourcing tool i.e. create block diagrams, schematics, or panel layouts and generate your BOM. If you’re ready for production and don’t want to use our factory, you can export your design and send it to your preferred shop.

Can I use my own components?
---
Yes. Blitzpanel has its growing component library that’s closely coupled with our ERP, but you can also import your own parts or request that we add missing ones. Note: custom components will affect the end quote and estimated ship date. 

How accurate are the quotes?
---
Quotes are instant and based on current component pricing, wiring, and panel build heuristics. For unusual parts or custom enclosures, we’ll flag items that need manual confirmation.

Do I need CAD experience?
---
Not necessarily. Blitzpanel is designed for electrical engineers and technicians, but the drag-and-drop layout and 3D viewer make it approachable even if you’ve never touched an ECAD tool.

Is Blitzpanel only for UL-508A shops?
---
No. The tool is useful for anyone designing control panels from OEM engineers to startups, but we’re building toward UL-compliant outputs so that shops can go straight to production without re-drawing.

Is my data private?
---
Yes. Your designs and BOMs remain private to your account unless you explicitly share them. We don’t sell design data.
